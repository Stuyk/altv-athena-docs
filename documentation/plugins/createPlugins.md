# Learn to Create Plugins

Plugins in the Athena Framework are made in a specific way. Meaning, that following this general structure will help you create robust plugins without touching the core of the framework.

It is important that when a plugin is created that is does not adjust the core of the Athena Framework. This ensures that compatability is future-proof and additional updates to the plugin can be made without over complicating it.

## Structure

All plugins should be placed inside the `src/core/plugins` folder.

The folder structure is very specific.

It consists of several folders inside your main folder.

* server
  * This should all be server-side code
* client
  * This should all be client-side code
* shared
  * This should be shared between server, client, and webview
* webview
  * This is a WebView Page you want to inject
  * DOES NOT SUPPORT IMAGES, SOUNDS, ETC. THEY BELONG IN THE `src-webviews/public` folder

```
src/core/plugins/core-example
  |───dependencies.json
  ├───client
  │   │   index.ts
  |   │
  │   └───src  
  │       │   file1.ts
  │       │   file2.ts
  │       │   file3.ts
  |
  ├───server
  │   │   index.ts
  │   │
  │   └───src
  │       │   file1.ts
  │       │   file2.ts
  │       │   file3.ts
  │
  ├───shared
  │   │   file1.ts
  │   │   file2.ts
  │   │   file3.ts
  │
  └───webview
      │   Example.vue
      │   tsconfig.json
      │
      ├───components
      │       Component1.vue
      │       Component2.vue
      │       Component3.vue
```

### Naming

Rules for Files and Folder(s)
- Plugins should use `kebab-case` for folder names.
  - ie. `door-plugin`
- File names should be `camelCase`.
  - ie. `mainDoorController.ts`
- Plugins should use their respective folders for imports
  - Server: `src/core/plugins/example-plugin/server`
    - The main import file for the plugin should be called `index.ts`.
  - Client: `src/core/plugins/example-plugin/client`
    - The main import file for the plugin should be called `index.ts`.
  - Shared: `src/core/plugins/example-plugin/shared`
  - WebView: `src/core/plugins/example-plugin/webview`
    - There must be a main `*.vue` file in this folder.
    - Keep all components and additional vue files in subfolders.
- Entry file for a Plugin should be `index.ts`
  - This applies to both `client` and `server`.

It is up to you as the plugin creator to provide `GOOD` instruction(s) on installation and removal of the plugin.

### Dependencies

If you have server-side dependencies for an npm package you can create a `dependencies.json` in the root of your plugin structure to auto-install dependencies for an end-user.

```json
{
    "dependencies": [
      "discord.js@latest"
    ],
    "devDependencies": [
      "glob"
    ]
}
```

Dependencies in `devDependencies` will not be installed during production mode of the server. Meaning if you want to use an npm package in the game mode you should put it in dependencies.

_Example dependencies.json_

## Registering a Server Plugin

In your plugin's `index` file you should register your plugin.

```typescript
import * as alt from 'alt-server';
import { PluginSystem } from '../../server/systems/plugins';

const PLUGIN_NAME = 'Example Plugin';

PluginSystem.registerPlugin(PLUGIN_NAME, () => {
    // Initialize other things for your plugin here...
    alt.log(`~lg~${PLUGIN_NAME} was Loaded`);
});
```

## Learn from Example

Last but not least you should always look at the existing plugins to get a general idea of how they work and how they're being implemented.
